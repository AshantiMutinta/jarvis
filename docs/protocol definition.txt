General Protocol Design

protocol_id = 1 byte 
body length = 1 byte 
device_id = 1 byte 
device_command = Variable length
Hour = 1 byte
Second =  1 byte
Checksum = 1 byte

Protocol Id is a5 for everything that is transmitted.
body length does not include protocol_id and device length. (Equal to total length - 2 bytes)



SetUpDeviceCommand from Server

protocol_id = a5
body_length = 5
device_id = 00
device_command = 00
hour = hour.now
Second=second.now
Checksum = 1 byte

RecieveDeviceCommandFromServer

protocol_id = a5
body_length = 5
device_id = From Assigned Device
device_command = 01
hour = hour.now
Second=second.now
Checksum = 1 byt
